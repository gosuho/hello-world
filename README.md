# hello-world
change myself
i'm 29 years old. 
i get my doctor's degree in the last year. My research direction is renewable energy ultilization.
Design and control of marine current turbine are the specific works.
However, i donot like it gradually since i could not learn or get the expected useful things/knowledges.
i want to change myself, get out of sushiquan, and learn something meaningful.
